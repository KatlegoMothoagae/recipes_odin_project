<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Fried chicken is a popular dish consisting of chicken pieces that have been coated in a seasoned flour or breadcrumb mixture and then deep-fried until golden brown and crispy. The chicken is typically seasoned with salt, pepper, and other spices or herbs such as paprika, garlic powder, and thyme to enhance its flavor.
    The coating gives the chicken a crunchy exterior while locking in moisture, resulting in tender and juicy meat inside. Fried chicken can be made using various cuts of chicken, including wings, thighs, drumsticks, and breasts.</p>
<p>The origins of fried chicken can be traced back to Southern cuisine in the United States, where it has become an iconic dish enjoyed by people around the world. It is often served with sides such as mashed potatoes, coleslaw, biscuits, and gravy, though it can also be enjoyed on its own or in sandwiches.</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>1 quart vegetable oil for frying</li>
    <li>4 ⅓ cups all-purpose flour, divided</li>
    <li>1 ½ tablespoons garlic salt</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon ground black pepper</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon paprika</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon poultry seasoning</li>
    <li>1 ½ cups beer, or as needed</li>
    <li>2 egg yolks, beaten</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
    <li>1 (3 pound) whole chicken, cut into pieces</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li> Heat oil in a deep fryer to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). </li>
    <li>Mix 3 cups flour, garlic salt, 1 tablespoon pepper, paprika, and poultry seasoning together in a medium bowl. </li>
    <li>Stir 1 1/2 cups beer, remaining 1 1/3 cups flour, egg yolks, salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper together in a separate bowl; thin with more beer if batter is too thick. </li>
    <li>Moisten chicken pieces with a little water, then dip in seasoned flour mixture. Shake off excess and dip in beer batter, then dip in the seasoned flour mixture once more. </li>
    <li>Lower chicken pieces carefully into the hot oil in batches. Fry until crispy and well-browned, about 15 to 18 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate to drain. </li>
